## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a real-time image segmentation web application using:

- **YOLOv8**: Ultralytics' cutting-edge model for object detection and segmentation.
- **Streamlit**: A rapid prototyping framework for interactive ML apps.

Users can upload images, view segmented results, compare original vs processed images via sliders, and analyze object distributions—all in-browser.
