Image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision that involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions. YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that can be used for image segmentation and object detection. In this web app, we will implement an interesting example using YOLOv8 for image segmentation. We can simply drop an image, View the identified segment a piece, a whole and the distribution of the identified segments. The essence of this application is to build a practical understanding and implementation of the powerful and light YOLOv8 for image segmentation and object detection
